                </p>
                
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>üìÑ View Job Applications</h2>
                <p>
                    Use this to see all active job applications. You can delete your job applications or update their statuses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clicking <strong>Edit Status</strong> will reveal a dropdown menu to change the job status. Updating the status to <strong>Interview</strong> will show a button: <strong>"Click here to add an interview"</strong>,
                    which takes you to a page where you can create an interview tied to that specific job application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> If an interview already exists, you must delete it before changing the job status back to "Applied".
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you've added a job posting URL, make sure it's valid. The button that appears will use it to open the job posting page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's also a toggle to show or hide the archive button. You can archive a job application after revealing this button.
                </p>

                <h2>üóÉÔ∏è Show Archive Mode</h2>
                <p>
                    Clicking <strong>Show Archive Mode</strong> will remove the usual navigation items ‚Äî like <strong>Add Job Application</strong>, <strong>View Job Applications</strong>, and <strong>View Interviews</strong> ‚Äî and replace them with two new sections:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>View Archived Applications</strong> ‚Äì Shows job applications you've archived. You can view full details and choose to <strong>unarchive</strong> them, which will also restore their linked interviews (if any).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>View Archived Interviews</strong> ‚Äì Displays interviews linked to archived applications. These are view-only and cannot be directly unarchived. To unarchive them, you must unarchive the related job application.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Archive mode helps you keep your dashboard clean while preserving old records. Use it to review past job applications and interviews.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Deletion, Archiving & Unarchiving Rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Deleting a job application ‚Äî whether active or archived ‚Äî will also delete its linked interview.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Only job applications can be archived. Archiving an application automatically archives its related interview.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Only job applications can be unarchived. Unarchiving an application will also unarchive its related interview.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Archived items are not editable. To make changes, either delete and re-create them, or unarchive them first.
                    </li>

            </section>
